# Smartphone-Project

This project showcases data wrangling and cleaning skills on a relevant and interesting dataset, along with creating visualizations that demonstrate the evolution of smartphones.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was scraped from the website GSMArena, which collects and records the specifications of all mobile devices released since the early 90s. The data was obtained using a custom Python script as of January 4th, 2023. [Click here](https://www.gsmarena.com/makers.php3) to visit the website source.

The dataset obtained from the website was not originally created with the intention of conducting such an analysis. As a result, the data was extremely dirty and required extensive cleaning and wrangling. The cleaning process was performed using the cleaners.py file, which was imported as a module/library in the Analysis and Overview Jupyter notebook.

## Visualizations

Various visualizations, including interactive ones, were created to illustrate how smartphone specifications and prices have evolved between 1990 and 2022. These visualizations provide insights into the changing trends and advancements in the smartphone industry over time.

Additionally, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis was conducted to examine the market focus of top smartphone brands. The PCA analysis provides valuable insights into the market strategies adopted by these brands.

## Future Work

Future work on this project could involve correlating the findings with actual sales data and benchmark values such as Antutu and DXOMark. This would help to understand how these specifications and features impact the performance and popularity of smartphones.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter notebook and code files for a detailed overview of the data wrangling process, visualizations, and analysis.
